        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Measuring by weight instead of volume will give the most consistent results!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                400 grams bread flour
            </li>
            <li>
                8 gram salt
            </li>
            <li>
                2 grams instant yeast
            </li>
            <li>
                280 grams warm water
            </li>
            <li>
                1/8 tsp white vinegar or lemon juice
            </li>
            <li>
                extra flour for dusting
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix the dough: Combine the flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl and mix with your hands until mostly
                homogenous. Combine the water and vinegar or lemon juice, then add to the bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scrape your dough-covered hand with your clean hand or with a metal or plastic dough scraper to get most
                of the dough into the bowl, then invert a tall-sided medium metal or glass bowl (or a cutting board) and
                place it on top of the large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Let dough rest at least 12 hours and up to 18 at room temperature (60 to 70 degrees)</li>
            <li>Shape the loaf.</li>
            <li>Proof the loaf. Cover and the dough ball to rise until it roughly doubles in size, about two hours.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven at least 30 min before baking with the cast iron dutch inside.</li>
            <li>There are more directions, but I'm done with this example site.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>Many people find kneading overwhelming, so being able to make bread and skip that step will be appealing.
            &nbsp;This makes a nice rustic, chewy bread that is delicious in many applications from sandwiches, grilled
            cheese, a side for pasta with some garlic and butter and much more!</p>
